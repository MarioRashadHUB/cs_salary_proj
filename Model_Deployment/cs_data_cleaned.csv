Founded in Silicon Valley, scaling in Gainesville, FL.

We are a profitable, bootstrapped tech startup offering competitive salary + equity packages to top candidates. Our office is in the Innovation Hub in Downtown Gainesville. Our first cofounders met as early hires at the successful fintech startup, Square.

Bridgerock Data is a Data Science first technology company focused on direct to consumer brands (DTC). This ecommerce market is growing fast. Few people know that at $61bn per year, the ecommerce platform, Shopify, sells more online than Walmart, and may soon pass the entire chain.

Bridgerock uses Data Science to show which ads are wasting money. We are not an AdTech agency. We audit the AdTech agencies. We solve important, practical, challenging problems. We focus on accuracy. Cutting low impact marketing spend is a big advantage to our clients.

About Cleverific

What's it like to work in engineering at Cleverific?

Inclusive culture. Our customers come from all backgrounds, from all around the world. We're committed to building an actively inclusive and progressive work environment that makes Cleverific an excellent home for everyone.

Ownership. Engineers are involved early in project planning and own projects from end-to-end. Rather than participate in tedious planning and estimate exercises, you'll learn about the full context of the project and take ownership for ensuring that the work gets done. You'll be expected to take responsibilities for the stated priorities of your projects while keeping in mind the needs of the team beyond your own role.

Focus time. We hate meetings. On most days, our office is just a nice quiet place with minimal interruptions so you can focus on getting your best work done and collaborate with whoever you need to.

Ship first. We ship prototypes as early as possible. We favor working software in any state over status reports and gantt charts.

What's it like to work at Cleverific?

Cleverific is a fully bootstrapped, profitable software company with no plans to take venture capital. This is a deliberate choice that allows us to make decisions in our best interests and our customers’ best interests. We'll never have to worry about fundraising rounds or the whims of a VC-packed board of directors. But this doesn’t mean we’re not ambitious. Our revenue doubled last year and we’re aiming to more than double again this year. You’ll fit right in with us if you want to be part of this kind of growth.

We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. Our workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.

Work-life balance. You'll work no more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis so you'll have time to pursue your other interests and responsibilities outside of work.

Unlimited PTO. We don't have any rules or accruals for how much time you can take per year. You're encouraged take regular vacations after important deadlines to come back refreshed, with new ideas and enthusiasm.

9x9 schedule. We take every other Friday off to take advantage of our lives in beautiful, sunny Santa Barbara. We use these days for personal appointments, sleeping in, wine tasting, long workouts, anything—it's a bonafide day off. Some of us still choose to work on select projects that are otherwise hard to prioritize.

About Cleverific

What's it like to work in engineering at Cleverific?

Inclusive culture. Our customers come from all backgrounds, from all around the world. We're committed to building an actively inclusive and progressive work environment that makes Cleverific an excellent home for everyone.

Ownership. Engineers are involved early in project planning and own projects from end-to-end. Rather than participate in tedious planning and estimate exercises, you'll learn about the full context of the project and take ownership for ensuring that the work gets done. You'll be expected to take responsibilities for the stated priorities of your projects while keeping in mind the needs of the team beyond your own role.

Focus time. We hate meetings. On most days, our office is just a nice quiet place with minimal interruptions so you can focus on getting your best work done and collaborate with whoever you need to.

Ship first. We ship prototypes as early as possible. We favor working software in any state over status reports and gantt charts.

What's it like to work at Cleverific?

Cleverific is a fully bootstrapped, profitable software company with no plans to take venture capital. This is a deliberate choice that allows us to make decisions in our best interests and our customers’ best interests. We'll never have to worry about fundraising rounds or the whims of a VC-packed board of directors. But this doesn’t mean we’re not ambitious. Our revenue doubled last year and we’re aiming to more than double again this year. You’ll fit right in with us if you want to be part of this kind of growth.

We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. Our workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.

Work-life balance. You'll work no more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis so you'll have time to pursue your other interests and responsibilities outside of work.

Unlimited PTO. We don't have any rules or accruals for how much time you can take per year. You're encouraged take regular vacations after important deadlines to come back refreshed, with new ideas and enthusiasm.

9x9 schedule. We take every other Friday off to take advantage of our lives in beautiful, sunny Santa Barbara. We use these days for personal appointments, sleeping in, wine tasting, long workouts, anything—it's a bonafide day off. Some of us still choose to work on select projects that are otherwise hard to prioritize.

You have experience in software development with Golang and Java.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Thoughtfulness

Internally, we look for chances to make each others days. Noticing someone needs a pick-me-up, remembering birthdays, and celebrating others success all help strengthen our internal bonds. Externally, we want to amaze people with how much we care about both the products we build and the services we provide that happens by noticing and acting on opportunities to value others.

High Performance

What we are trying to accomplish is hard. While thoughtfulness is central to how we engage others, a personal ethic of high performance is needed across the company for us to succeed. High performance is a major focus in every role across the company.

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

This is just a taste of the type of big problem we want you to solve. We seek a software engineer to help drive a digital product team on a mission to bring a new type of interaction to a market once exclusively driven by in-person relationships.

As a member of a cross-functional team of engineers, data scientists, designers, and product managers, you’ll provide input and have your voice heard on key product decisions, and the tools and resources to build and ship ideas quickly. You’ll be a part of a startup-like environment in a company with thousands of existing customers.

Who you are


Like Git? Great. Have a favorite data store? Front-end framework? Way of working? Propose it! We believe that a collaborative technology team focused on outcomes is capable of making rational decisions based on system-risk, ramp-up time and ease-of-use. Utility trumps novelty..

Some signs you might be ready:
You’re comfortable with ambiguity and you accept the challenge of figuring it out. You’re more than a coder; you’re someone who knows how to deliver. You want to work with a cross-functional team to design a solution as well as implement it.
You put users first and actively seek user feedback. You build to learn. You understand the role of validation and its place in the product development process.
You're deeply familiar with at least one programming language and its ecosystem, and you're comfortable learning others.
You value repeatability and automation. Automated testing and infrastructure as code are a way of life.
You're comfortable reading and debugging code written by others, and you write your own code to allow others to do the same. To that end, you appreciate the value of common standards.
You can recognize common code smells, and you know how to address them. You understand design patterns and know when and how to apply them.
You view security as a first-class concern. You can recognize common application vulnerabilities, and you know how to remediate them.
You look forward to having your work reviewed...and reviewing the work of others.
What you’ll own
Proposing tool chains, standards and practices.
Write snappy code, from flexible JavaScript libraries to concise, reusable services.
Work with the latest open-source projects designed to scale.
Build components for products that create market-defining experiences.
Creatively figure out how to use customer data to inform decision-making.
Work with product managers, designers, and data scientists to translate research findings into features.
Tools We Use

About Cleverific

What's it like to work in engineering at Cleverific?

Inclusive culture. Our customers come from all backgrounds, from all around the world. We're committed to building an actively inclusive and progressive work environment that makes Cleverific an excellent home for everyone.

Ownership. Engineers are involved early in project planning and own projects from end-to-end. Rather than participate in tedious planning and estimate exercises, you'll learn about the full context of the project and take ownership for ensuring that the work gets done. You'll be expected to take responsibilities for the stated priorities of your projects while keeping in mind the needs of the team beyond your own role.

Focus time. We hate meetings. On most days, our office is just a nice quiet place with minimal interruptions so you can focus on getting your best work done and collaborate with whoever you need to.

Ship first. We ship prototypes as early as possible. We favor working software in any state over status reports and gantt charts.

What's it like to work at Cleverific?

Cleverific is a fully bootstrapped, profitable software company with no plans to take venture capital. This is a deliberate choice that allows us to make decisions in our best interests and our customers’ best interests. We'll never have to worry about fundraising rounds or the whims of a VC-packed board of directors. But this doesn’t mean we’re not ambitious. Our revenue doubled last year and we’re aiming to more than double again this year. You’ll fit right in with us if you want to be part of this kind of growth.

We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. Our workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.

Work-life balance. You'll work no more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis so you'll have time to pursue your other interests and responsibilities outside of work.

Unlimited PTO. We don't have any rules or accruals for how much time you can take per year. You're encouraged take regular vacations after important deadlines to come back refreshed, with new ideas and enthusiasm.

9x9 schedule. We take every other Friday off to take advantage of our lives in beautiful, sunny Santa Barbara. We use these days for personal appointments, sleeping in, wine tasting, long workouts, anything—it's a bonafide day off. Some of us still choose to work on select projects that are otherwise hard to prioritize.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.",4.1,"Cisco Systems - Engineering - Software

You pride yourself on being the expert in any situation. And when you find that youre not the expert, you are more excited than frustrated because that means you get to dive in and learn what you need to learn to become the expert.

Essential Functions and Job Responsibilities:
Provide comprehensive operational and maintenance support to three MARFORRES web based application systems: 1) Memorandum Fiscal Services (MFS); 2) Training, Exercise and Employment Program (TEEP), Transportation of people, and transportation of things (T3); and MFR Manpower. Below is a brief description of each of the applications.

MFS is the primary MARFORES financial system used to integrate diverse data from external systems. MFS delivers a wide span of support covering multiple functional areas within the MARFORRES financial community such as the following: budgeting support, authorization funding management, conference request routing, unit travel card processing, transactional research/validation, financial reporting, billing reconciliation, Defense Travel System account management, and evaluation assessments. MFS is a web based system supporting more than 500 active users throughout the continental United States in support of the MARFORRES financial community. MFS is an ever-evolving financial tool designed to provide accurate and expedient budgeting and accounting information to assist managers in making informed decisions effecting the command’s financial posture. With Business Process Reengineering as the main focus of MFS, the system is designed to fill capability gaps, automate and streamline workflows, and provide integrated reporting capabilities. MFS is agile and able to adapt quickly to the changing DoD financial landscape as new requirements and policy changes must be incorporated into the system to ensure compliancy. MFS is a primary facilitating system for MARFORRES in audit support by offering document retention and rapid retrieval capabilities. MFS has three major external data feeds and two additional internal data exchanges which are processed daily from these Marine Corps systems: SMARTS, MROWS, and GCSS-MC. Currently there are 4 data exchanges, 3 are one-directional (incoming) and one interface is bi-directional. Once the data is received, MFS runs an integration processing job to prepare this data for end users every morning. On average annually, the MFS programming cycle includes 3-4 major projects (greater than two weeks design phase – 4 weeks in the development phase) and roughly 8 minor projects (under two weeks in duration). The new development requirements range from cosmetic modifications to major modular rewrites based on the prioritization of the MARFORRES MFS Configuration Control Board. In addition, there are several items that fall outside of the normal System Development Life Cycle that require support such as: COOP preparation, ADHOC reporting support, system/network troubleshooting, and tasks required to maintain the system’s Authority to Operate (ATO). The contractor should be familiar with T-SQL DB and ASP.NET Web Forms in VB to work within the MFS program.

T3 is a web based system designed to be a Commander’s TEEP management and transportation management tool, capable of identifying unit, personnel, equipment, and resources prior to the execution of training exercises or deployments COMMARFORRES is responsible for the training and the operational readiness of 39,000 Marine Reservists. MARFORRES G-3/5 is responsible for managing a financial database that integrates Operating Budgets with training and exercises, which result in resource utilization over time. Resources are defined as units and their associated personnel, equipment, and funding. The MARFORRES G-3/5 Department provides budgeting, accounting, execution and financial support services through the T3 Database to four Major Subordinate Commands (4th Marine Aircraft Wing, 4th Marine Division, 4th Marine Logistics Group, and the Force Headquarters Group) in addition to many major programs managed at the headquarter level. A major challenge facing the MARFORRES G-3/5 is the geographical dispersion of the more than 160 sites throughout the United States.

The MFR IRR Management Application is a web based system designed to maintain accurate and current personnel records on members of the Individual Ready Reserve Components, to include mailing address, physical condition, military qualifications, dependency status, civilian occupational skills, availability for service, and other information that is needed to determine strength levels of the Military Services. Below outlines the current operating environment for this task area:

Currently Microsoft Visual Studio is used to develop the code, and Azure DevOps server for version control, testing and release management capabilities. The development team in coordination with the Marine Forces Reserve Server/Network personnel to conduct the user acceptance testing, performance, and load testing of the applications. Release notes are published to the home page of each application. Currently there are no set monthly release scheduled for changes to production. In the current environment MFR follows an agile schema, sprints are anywhere from 2-6 weeks, and depends on the complexity of the project.

The demands on each application translate to a functionality backlog of 50-100 items varying in levels of complexity. Each program manager operates on a continuous agile development schedule producing new functionality at least once a month. Our software engineers receives roughly on average of 10 tickets per month; most are for minor bugs or cosmetic changes. Non “bug” tickets are required to be presented to each applications Configuration Control Board (CCB). Out of the 10 tickets, about 2-3 requests per week ranging from simple bug fixes or cosmetic adjustments; major rewrites range from about (1-2 per year). Each application must also be updated to meet current technology platform changes which equate to major re-writes every three years on average.

MFS has roughly 500-600 active daily users, T3 has approximately 300 active daily users, and MFR Manpower has approximately 200. MFS has right at 150,000 lines of code, while MFR Manpower has approximately 12,000; T3 system has approximately 100,000.

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Who are we?

We’re FarApp, a rapidly growing e-commerce automation solution company. It sounds like a lot of buzz words, but we really are growing fast and want to bring in new talented folks to help manage our rapidly expanding customer base. We hope that we can find that talent in you!

FarApp is a SAAS company who has been in business for over 15 years. In those 15 years, we’ve expanded our original codebase to over 1.5 million lines of code processing millions of operations a day. We connect to over 60 endpoints to help our customers become versatile e-commerce participants.

What will you be doing?

You’ll be diving into our code and figuring out ways to permanently solve problems that our customers either create or point out. This requires that you have a comfort with reading code in the context of a larger system without fear and that you're willing to try out and test solutions. You need to be comfortable deploying code 10 times a day into a live environment as you solve real-world problems.

You’ll also be helping to expand our product line. We add new endpoints to our service all the time, meaning that we must develop new connectors to integrate within our current system. That could mean something simple like a new logistics company, or it could be a new marketplace that has popped up that people are flocking to.

You’ll also be participating in our continuing effort to reduce our integration time. Currently, we have an average integration time for new customers of 40 days. We strongly believe we can reduce that to less than a day, maybe less than a couple of hours. We need your creative, intelligent ideas and initiative to make that happen.

We're looking for somebody who is passionate about software and is interested to start at the ground level with a company so that they can help it grow and share in its success. We hope that you're excited to make a big impact because you'll have plenty of opportunities to do that. We don't need somebody with a lot of experience but just need somebody who can learn new technologies quickly and is excited to make learning part of their regular routine.

Cool things:

Competitive salary with great benefits

Working from home! We’re evil and make you work from home two days a week!

We offer health, dental and vision plans.

We have a 401k plan.

Bi-monthly catered lunches and office snacks.

Bi-annual raises and performance-based bonuses.

Monthly company outings

Things you need (requirements):
BS Degree in Computer Science or related field
Knowledge in Python, Flask, TurboGears, AngularJS is a plus
Experience with eCommerce marketplaces and/or platforms and APIs is a plus
We're recruiting for applicants at levels of experience who are passionate about solving problems.

Kenna Security is revolutionizing cyber risk with a SaaS-based platform that uses data science to combine vulnerability data with exploit intelligence to measure risk, predict attacks and prioritize remediation. We are leading the way in helping enterprises reduce their risk while increasing their efficiency and preventing attacks. Kenna Security was recently named one of the top 10 hottest start-ups and named to the Inc. 500 fastest growing companies list.


There are a lot of security companies out there, but no one is doing what Kenna is doing: giving our customers the ability to measure their risk landscape and truly protect their environments from the ever-present threat of a breach. As a result, we’re seeing phenomenal growth as some of the top companies in the world flock to our platform. We have solid venture funding, an astonishing team who will fight beside you to accomplish the impossible, and we even offer great benefits and stock options.

We’re looking to hire super smart engineers who like to take ownership of our technical problems, and work autonomously to get things built and shipped without any unnecessary bureaucracy. Our team is built on trust, accountability and transparency. We sometimes ask a lot from our employees, but always reciprocate back with the same flexibility they give us.

We’re small enough that every employee receives a healthy amount of equity and the chance to have a significant impact on technical process and company culture, but large enough that we’ve established product-market fit, so our engineers can focus their energy on scaling our platform to keep up with the growth of the business.

This position is an opportunity for an engineer to take ownership of significant technical areas across the entire stack by tackling complex analytical problems across a large data set in a tech-centric company.

Responsibilities:
Full-stack software design and development, primarily in Ruby.
Data modeling and querying at scale in MySQL and Elasticsearch.
Pragmatic technical decision-making to ensure we're delivering high quality software as quickly as possible.
Qualifications:
Experience working in small teams with a great deal of autonomy.
An understanding of the pace of a startup (and the excitement to jump into it).
Experience with some or all of our existing stack: Ruby, Rails, MySQL, Elasticsearch.
Significant experience with dynamic languages, agile methodologies, test-driven development, and distributed systems.
Experience communicating with stakeholders and customers in the lifecycle of a technology product or project.

Essential Functions and Job Responsibilities:
Provide comprehensive operational and maintenance support to three MARFORRES web based application systems: 1) Memorandum Fiscal Services (MFS); 2) Training, Exercise and Employment Program (TEEP), Transportation of people, and transportation of things (T3); and MFR Manpower. Below is a brief description of each of the applications.

MFS is the primary MARFORES financial system used to integrate diverse data from external systems. MFS delivers a wide span of support covering multiple functional areas within the MARFORRES financial community such as the following: budgeting support, authorization funding management, conference request routing, unit travel card processing, transactional research/validation, financial reporting, billing reconciliation, Defense Travel System account management, and evaluation assessments. MFS is a web based system supporting more than 500 active users throughout the continental United States in support of the MARFORRES financial community. MFS is an ever-evolving financial tool designed to provide accurate and expedient budgeting and accounting information to assist managers in making informed decisions effecting the command’s financial posture. With Business Process Reengineering as the main focus of MFS, the system is designed to fill capability gaps, automate and streamline workflows, and provide integrated reporting capabilities. MFS is agile and able to adapt quickly to the changing DoD financial landscape as new requirements and policy changes must be incorporated into the system to ensure compliancy. MFS is a primary facilitating system for MARFORRES in audit support by offering document retention and rapid retrieval capabilities. MFS has three major external data feeds and two additional internal data exchanges which are processed daily from these Marine Corps systems: SMARTS, MROWS, and GCSS-MC. Currently there are 4 data exchanges, 3 are one-directional (incoming) and one interface is bi-directional. Once the data is received, MFS runs an integration processing job to prepare this data for end users every morning. On average annually, the MFS programming cycle includes 3-4 major projects (greater than two weeks design phase – 4 weeks in the development phase) and roughly 8 minor projects (under two weeks in duration). The new development requirements range from cosmetic modifications to major modular rewrites based on the prioritization of the MARFORRES MFS Configuration Control Board. In addition, there are several items that fall outside of the normal System Development Life Cycle that require support such as: COOP preparation, ADHOC reporting support, system/network troubleshooting, and tasks required to maintain the system’s Authority to Operate (ATO). The contractor should be familiar with T-SQL DB and ASP.NET Web Forms in VB to work within the MFS program.

T3 is a web based system designed to be a Commander’s TEEP management and transportation management tool, capable of identifying unit, personnel, equipment, and resources prior to the execution of training exercises or deployments COMMARFORRES is responsible for the training and the operational readiness of 39,000 Marine Reservists. MARFORRES G-3/5 is responsible for managing a financial database that integrates Operating Budgets with training and exercises, which result in resource utilization over time. Resources are defined as units and their associated personnel, equipment, and funding. The MARFORRES G-3/5 Department provides budgeting, accounting, execution and financial support services through the T3 Database to four Major Subordinate Commands (4th Marine Aircraft Wing, 4th Marine Division, 4th Marine Logistics Group, and the Force Headquarters Group) in addition to many major programs managed at the headquarter level. A major challenge facing the MARFORRES G-3/5 is the geographical dispersion of the more than 160 sites throughout the United States.

The MFR IRR Management Application is a web based system designed to maintain accurate and current personnel records on members of the Individual Ready Reserve Components, to include mailing address, physical condition, military qualifications, dependency status, civilian occupational skills, availability for service, and other information that is needed to determine strength levels of the Military Services. Below outlines the current operating environment for this task area:

Currently Microsoft Visual Studio is used to develop the code, and Azure DevOps server for version control, testing and release management capabilities. The development team in coordination with the Marine Forces Reserve Server/Network personnel to conduct the user acceptance testing, performance, and load testing of the applications. Release notes are published to the home page of each application. Currently there are no set monthly release scheduled for changes to production. In the current environment MFR follows an agile schema, sprints are anywhere from 2-6 weeks, and depends on the complexity of the project.

The demands on each application translate to a functionality backlog of 50-100 items varying in levels of complexity. Each program manager operates on a continuous agile development schedule producing new functionality at least once a month. Our software engineers receives roughly on average of 10 tickets per month; most are for minor bugs or cosmetic changes. Non “bug” tickets are required to be presented to each applications Configuration Control Board (CCB). Out of the 10 tickets, about 2-3 requests per week ranging from simple bug fixes or cosmetic adjustments; major rewrites range from about (1-2 per year). Each application must also be updated to meet current technology platform changes which equate to major re-writes every three years on average.

MFS has roughly 500-600 active daily users, T3 has approximately 300 active daily users, and MFR Manpower has approximately 200. MFS has right at 150,000 lines of code, while MFR Manpower has approximately 12,000; T3 system has approximately 100,000. In addition to the number of lines of codes, each system has a code quality range, which ranges from adequate to exceptional. These are mature systems which needs to be maintained while at the same time prepare to update to new technologies and help develop new features.

Software Engineer,$107K-$131K (Glassdoor est.),"At Kin, we’re looking for self-motivated thinkers ready to make a change for our customers. We value tackling challenges and breaking down walls – but being chill about it.

Kin Insurance is an insurtech startup that sells affordable, user-friendly homeowners insurance. Unlike many startups that gather users and figure out how to be profitable later, we are selling a product that homeowners need and depend on now. We’re innovating in an industry largely untouched by tech, so we are always thinking big.

We believe autonomy is key to job satisfaction, which is why we say the person closest to the problem should solve it. It’s also why we offer unlimited vacation time: we trust in our team to manage their own projects and time. If you want the chance to develop your skills, work with some of the best minds in the industry, and see what you’re really capable of, come learn and grow with us.

About the Development Team

You’ll be part of a growing company and a growing but lean development team. In practice, that means you’ll have the support you need to get your work done, but you’ll also have to be familiar with the whole code base and all of our products and services. Our team is business-minded, so everyone has good working knowledge about the company, fundraising, and the insurance industry. The dev team is also cross-functional, so you’ll work with our insurance experts, quality assurance, product team, and operations very closely.

We’re very product-focused and don’t let tech fads get in the way of shipping new features—but we also value clean code, automated testing, and other sustainable practices.

In short: we move fast, are excited about the work we do, and don’t let non-essentials get in the way of building great products.

So, What’s the Role?

You will collaborate daily with various members of our development team, creating and modifying software to improve our customers’ experience. Our main goal at Kin is to make insurance accessible and affordable, and much of this stems from innovation and efficiency.

A Day in the Life May Include:
Writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code in Ruby on Rails (with some Javascript and Python)
Collaborating with various members of the development team to complete multiple projects. We’re a startup, so we’ll keep you busy
Providing subject matter expertise and support.

I’ve Got Skills, But Do I Have the Necessary Ones?

You might be a good fit if you are:
Comfortable in a startup environment – we’re fast-paced, self-motivated, and determined to change the industry
A fast learner, ready to bring previous knowledge to this position and continue developing along the way
A professional developer with a minimum of 3 years of previous experience
Experienced with designing Ruby, Python, or Node applications
Familiar with fintech – a plus, but not required.

At this time, we are unable to sponsor employment visas.

Oh, and We’ve Got You Covered

Being in the insurance industry, we recognize the importance of comprehensive benefits for you and your family. That’s why we provide a variety of options and coverage levels to customize a plan that fits your needs. These are just some of the benefits and perks we offer:

=== WHY CISCO ===

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Overview:


Two Barrels is hiring a Ruby on Rails Software Engineers for $110,000/year plus a $10,000 hiring bonus. This is a full time 40 hour/week position with company benefits in Spokane, Washington.

This particular job is for Ruby experience, but we understand that ROR or a flavor of Ruby isn’t super common locally. If you have solid software engineering experience in a different language, we have a solid path to this mid level software engineer role by coming on board as a JR ROR Software Engineer and working together to monitor how quickly you get up to speed on Ruby with the intent of moving you to this Mid Level Ruby on Rails Software Engineer role when you become proficient in ROR.

About the Job:

At Two Barrels you will work with a close-knit group of engineers who come from a diverse mix of backgrounds and experiences. We build out new exciting Rails projects, maintain and refactor older Rack based ones built in POR. We are constantly evolving, growing and willing to try new technologies and techniques, as long as we meet the businesses needs.

We want someone who is eager to learn and help others but can also take on a project independently and be just fine. Our team supports each other and understands not everyone is the same – some of us are great at CI/CD development, some of us are wizards at SQL, and others just love Plain Old Ruby – meaning although we expect you to work the full-stack we also understand if you prefer to work in one area more than the other.

How to Apply:

Please apply through the link below. It’s a coding job, so showing us some code would be helpful. Preferably a flavor of Ruby or Javascript, but anything for now will do. We will do an initial phone interview, a video call with a small group of our team, and then if everyone is still liking things, typically we’d have you come in and meet everyone, but with Covid we’re doing group video calls right now while we’re all working remote.

Wage:

$110,000/year
*$10,000 hiring bonus**
Responsibilities:
Be a good human
Treat your co-workers with respect
Have a Growth Mindset, not a Fixed Mindset
Help us consistently release high end software
Monitors and ensures automated processes run as expected
Help design and build novel systems from scratch
Minimum Qualifications:
Bachelor's Degree in related field or related work experience
3+ years professional experience with full stack application development
Intimately familiar with Rails and Ruby
Experience with front-end web development, HTML, CSS, Javascript
You find satisfaction in a job well done and want to solve hard problems
You have 10 fingers or can type the equivalent speed of a 10 fingered person
Preferred Qualifications:
Experience with designing, building, and maintaining efficient, reusable, and reliable Ruby code
Strong grasp of security principles and how they apply to e-commerce applications
Experience in planning and delivering software
Able to work in an agile environment with a focus on continuous integration
Comfortable with using Docker
Comfortable working with Vue
General understanding of AWS and the services within: ECS, EC2, S3, and RDS
You bring some weird or quirky new aspect of living and humanity to our workforce

Why you might like this job:


You’ve been building large rails apps for other companies. The ones with carrots dangling in front of you, hipster benefits, slippery ladders, and always wondered if there’s a place where profits and titles aren’t everyone’s motivation. Where people just want you to make great software. You like the idea of working for a locally owned and operated company that competes in an extremely competitive space nationwide. You like it that your work matters today and will affect millions of business customers of ours.

You like the idea that you could find a place like this in Spokane, where we have 4 seasons, you can buy a great house for a great price and if you have to commute longer than 20 minutes here, people would probably move or not work there. You like it that there’s 5 ski hills within 2 hours. Endless outdoor activities, and people who are here don’t want you bragging about it to cool actual tech cities. You don’t like bugs or humidity or a million people living in your city.

You love to code, but you want to take part in the planning without being required to deal with stakeholders and project managers all day. You want to make cool stuff. You want your cool stuff to be really good. But most importantly, if you made a dish of noodles and butter for someone and asked them what they thought of it, if they said it was ok or good and didn’t give you feedback, you’d feel a little left out… you’d want a little more… because ok or good isn’t fulfilling to you.

But… it’s just a job. Yourself/Family/Friends/Personal Time is number 1. Work is number 2 or 3 depending on if you have religion in your life. Our goal is to use the incredible business we’ve been blessed to be a part of to support all of our personal time. We all want to live a full personal life and then we think we’ll have more fun working together during the day, if we know there’s a clear cut off and can create a work environment where we can not only go home, but mentally shut off work and mentally go home also. There’s no hipster saving or changing the world bs mission statement here. We try to make it a non-hostile job that pays well and doesn’t stress you out so you can call it a day and go have fun personally.

Benefits:

Great Wage
18 days paid time off
4 paid holidays off of your choosing

Who are we?

We’re FarApp, a rapidly growing e-commerce automation solution company. It sounds like a lot of buzz words, but we really are growing fast and want to bring in new talented folks to help manage our rapidly expanding customer base. We hope that we can find that talent in you!

FarApp is a SAAS company who has been in business for over 15 years. In those 15 years, we’ve expanded our original codebase to over 1.5 million lines of code processing millions of operations a day. We connect to over 60 endpoints to help our customers become versatile e-commerce participants.

What will you be doing?

You’ll be diving into our code and figuring out ways to permanently solve problems that our customers either create or point out. This requires that you have a comfort with reading code in the context of a larger system without fear and that you're willing to try out and test solutions. You need to be comfortable deploying code 10 times a day into a live environment as you solve real-world problems.

You’ll also be helping to expand our product line. We add new endpoints to our service all the time, meaning that we must develop new connectors to integrate within our current system. That could mean something simple like a new logistics company, or it could be a new marketplace that has popped up that people are flocking to.

You’ll also be participating in our continuing effort to reduce our integration time. Currently, we have an average integration time for new customers of 40 days. We strongly believe we can reduce that to less than a day, maybe less than a couple of hours. We need your creative, intelligent ideas and initiative to make that happen.

We're looking for somebody who is passionate about software and is interested to start at the ground level with a company so that they can help it grow and share in its success. We hope that you're excited to make a big impact because you'll have plenty of opportunities to do that. We don't need somebody with a lot of experience but just need somebody who can learn new technologies quickly and is excited to make learning part of their regular routine.

Cool things:

Competitive salary with great benefits

Working from home! We’re evil and make you work from home two days a week!

We offer health, dental and vision plans.

We have a 401k plan.

Bi-monthly catered lunches and office snacks.

Bi-annual raises and performance-based bonuses.

Monthly company outings

Things you need (requirements):
BS Degree in Computer Science or related field
Knowledge in Python, Flask, TurboGears, AngularJS is a plus
Experience with eCommerce marketplaces and/or platforms and APIs is a plus
We're recruiting for applicants at levels of experience who are passionate about solving problems.

Essential Functions and Job Responsibilities:
Provide comprehensive operational and maintenance support to three MARFORRES web based application systems: 1) Memorandum Fiscal Services (MFS); 2) Training, Exercise and Employment Program (TEEP), Transportation of people, and transportation of things (T3); and MFR Manpower. Below is a brief description of each of the applications.

MFS is the primary MARFORES financial system used to integrate diverse data from external systems. MFS delivers a wide span of support covering multiple functional areas within the MARFORRES financial community such as the following: budgeting support, authorization funding management, conference request routing, unit travel card processing, transactional research/validation, financial reporting, billing reconciliation, Defense Travel System account management, and evaluation assessments. MFS is a web based system supporting more than 500 active users throughout the continental United States in support of the MARFORRES financial community. MFS is an ever-evolving financial tool designed to provide accurate and expedient budgeting and accounting information to assist managers in making informed decisions effecting the command’s financial posture. With Business Process Reengineering as the main focus of MFS, the system is designed to fill capability gaps, automate and streamline workflows, and provide integrated reporting capabilities. MFS is agile and able to adapt quickly to the changing DoD financial landscape as new requirements and policy changes must be incorporated into the system to ensure compliancy. MFS is a primary facilitating system for MARFORRES in audit support by offering document retention and rapid retrieval capabilities. MFS has three major external data feeds and two additional internal data exchanges which are processed daily from these Marine Corps systems: SMARTS, MROWS, and GCSS-MC. Currently there are 4 data exchanges, 3 are one-directional (incoming) and one interface is bi-directional. Once the data is received, MFS runs an integration processing job to prepare this data for end users every morning. On average annually, the MFS programming cycle includes 3-4 major projects (greater than two weeks design phase – 4 weeks in the development phase) and roughly 8 minor projects (under two weeks in duration). The new development requirements range from cosmetic modifications to major modular rewrites based on the prioritization of the MARFORRES MFS Configuration Control Board. In addition, there are several items that fall outside of the normal System Development Life Cycle that require support such as: COOP preparation, ADHOC reporting support, system/network troubleshooting, and tasks required to maintain the system’s Authority to Operate (ATO). The contractor should be familiar with T-SQL DB and ASP.NET Web Forms in VB to work within the MFS program.

T3 is a web based system designed to be a Commander’s TEEP management and transportation management tool, capable of identifying unit, personnel, equipment, and resources prior to the execution of training exercises or deployments COMMARFORRES is responsible for the training and the operational readiness of 39,000 Marine Reservists. MARFORRES G-3/5 is responsible for managing a financial database that integrates Operating Budgets with training and exercises, which result in resource utilization over time. Resources are defined as units and their associated personnel, equipment, and funding. The MARFORRES G-3/5 Department provides budgeting, accounting, execution and financial support services through the T3 Database to four Major Subordinate Commands (4th Marine Aircraft Wing, 4th Marine Division, 4th Marine Logistics Group, and the Force Headquarters Group) in addition to many major programs managed at the headquarter level. A major challenge facing the MARFORRES G-3/5 is the geographical dispersion of the more than 160 sites throughout the United States.

The MFR IRR Management Application is a web based system designed to maintain accurate and current personnel records on members of the Individual Ready Reserve Components, to include mailing address, physical condition, military qualifications, dependency status, civilian occupational skills, availability for service, and other information that is needed to determine strength levels of the Military Services. Below outlines the current operating environment for this task area:

Currently Microsoft Visual Studio is used to develop the code, and Azure DevOps server for version control, testing and release management capabilities. The development team in coordination with the Marine Forces Reserve Server/Network personnel to conduct the user acceptance testing, performance, and load testing of the applications. Release notes are published to the home page of each application. Currently there are no set monthly release scheduled for changes to production. In the current environment MFR follows an agile schema, sprints are anywhere from 2-6 weeks, and depends on the complexity of the project.

The demands on each application translate to a functionality backlog of 50-100 items varying in levels of complexity. Each program manager operates on a continuous agile development schedule producing new functionality at least once a month. Our software engineers receives roughly on average of 10 tickets per month; most are for minor bugs or cosmetic changes. Non “bug” tickets are required to be presented to each applications Configuration Control Board (CCB). Out of the 10 tickets, about 2-3 requests per week ranging from simple bug fixes or cosmetic adjustments; major rewrites range from about (1-2 per year). Each application must also be updated to meet current technology platform changes which equate to major re-writes every three years on average.

MFS has roughly 500-600 active daily users, T3 has approximately 300 active daily users, and MFR Manpower has approximately 200. MFS has right at 150,000 lines of code, while MFR Manpower has approximately 12,000; T3 system has approximately 100,000. In addition to the number of lines of codes, each system has a code quality range, which ranges from adequate to exceptional. These are mature systems which needs to be maintained while at the same time prepare to update to new technologies and help develop new features.

"Software Engineer, Data Platform",$65K-$78K (Glassdoor est.),"At Nuna, our mission is to make high-quality healthcare affordable for everyone. We are dedicated to tackling one of our nation's biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.

Nuna is committed to simple principles: a rigorous understanding of data, modern technology, and most importantly, compassion and care for our fellow human. We want to know what really works, what doesn't—and why.

Nuna partners with healthcare payers, including government agencies and health plans, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.

YOUR TEAM


Nuna's Value Platform team is building an impactful new product to help turn value-based care into a reality within the United States healthcare system. Value-based healthcare is a delivery model where hospitals are paid based on patient health outcomes, instead of the traditional fee for service model. These value-based payment arrangements are transforming healthcare, but operationalizing them is challenging and complex. That's why we are tackling the daunting task of making it easier, by automating these value-based arrangements in an accurate, reliable, and transparent way.

At the core of these agreements is a considerable amount of data from various sources. The Value Platform team is building a high throughput pipeline to efficiently calculate performance measures for providers, identify opportunities for improvement, and present these insights in an easily digestible way.

Hack the Full Stack
The engineers hack up and down the technology stack. It’s not uncommon for an engineer to go from backend coding to user experience design, from the video encoding pipeline to system scalability, from site maintenance to iOS/Android development. The company engineers own what they build from start to finish. They ship to production multiple times per day and keep unnecessary process to a minimum so they can maintain pace of rapid development.
They are actively hiring engineers who are looking to build a completely new kind of product and who have a passion for back-end and/or front-end development.

Infrastructure
The company's infrastructure consists of thousands of connected machines in nearly 100 data-centers across the country, with new machines spinning up every week. The company is harnessing petabyte storage and petaflop compute power in a highly distributed environment. The systems ingest roughly 50Gb of video per second, then transcode, segment, and encrypt it to deliver live television to users. Meanwhile, DVR storage system writes millions of episodes to disk every day. They operate in two different environments: on commercial cloud infrastructure, as well as within the unpredictable world of remotely managed hardware in a wide variety of hosting environments across the country.
As a backend engineer you will be responsible for:
Brainstorming, designing, implementing, and rolling out the next generation of the company system to handle an order of magnitude more channels, users, and recordings.
Developing video pipeline: building a highly available transcoding, segmentation, and video hosting and storage system.
Automating system configuration: since they are a small team, constantly deploying both new hardware systems and code in cloud infrastructure, we have no choice but to heavily automate infrastructure.
Hacking on monitoring and management system: graph, track, and alert on all kinds of metrics up and down our stack, giving important insight into performance trends and helping catch issues before they impact users.
Finding cheaper, faster, better solutions: both in our cloud environment and our hardware-based systems, they are always trying to reduce costs and improve product.
They are language agnostic, but most of server-side code is written in Golang, Node, and Ruby, with some C++ and Python. The centralized infrastructure is built out on Kubernetes, and practice continuous deployment across all systems.

Projected Start Date: ASAP
Status: Full-time
Location: San Francisco, CA

Compensation: Includes competitive salary, company stock options and health benefits.

***Commensurate with Experience***

They value a diverse and inclusive workplace and welcome people of different backgrounds, experiences, skills, and perspectives. The company is an equal opportunity employer.

May 27, 2020

We have an opportunity for a part-time, experienced software developer to help with the ongoing development of an AI platform and to advise on engineering decisions and best practices. We envision that this work will be an even split between programming tasks and planning and consulting tasks.

Essential skills include Python and Tensorflow. The anticipated time commitment is 20 hours/week for June- July, 2020, and then continuing with 4 hours/week for August 2020 through December 2021. Competitive salary (not benefits eligible).

Background: This relates to an ongoing, DARPA funded research project on multi-agent reinforcement learning and the AI-driven design of dynamic economic mechanisms. We have developed a custom version of OpenAI Gym, OpenAI Baselines and ALE (Arcade Learning Environment) that supports two-player Atari games and linking multiple Atari games for three or more player environments. Our ambition is to create a framework that will become the de facto standard for future multi-agent reinforcement learning research in the same way that Gym and Baselines have for current single-agent RL.

Example Tasks: As an immediate step, we would like to migrate our project to the latest versions of Gym and Baselines. This will entail working with team members to decide which parts will be needed going forward, suggesting ways to simplify existing code and interfaces, and implementing these changes. Once migrated, we would track changes in the vanilla Gymand Baselines repositories.

In the future, we anticipate high-level planning around software architecture, especially defining interfaces between different parts of the project; advice on best practices to follow; and implementation (e.g., specific Atari environments and learning algorithms within Gym and Baselines, and design of APIs to expose economic resources and mechanisms in a flexible way, with an eye to creating a multi-agent RL version of Gym and Baselines). Work and advice on other tasks are also possible, depending on background and interests (e.g., on Atari 2600 assembly, on scaling out to cloud compute resources such as Amazon AWS, browser-based tools for human data collection in JS, and backend OpenAI gym environments in Python).

Typical duties include:
High-level planning and advice on software architecture
API construction
Implementation of key software infrastructure
Advice and training on coding best practices
Writing documentation and unit tests
Participation in weekly group meetings (currently Friday 11am Eastern time, via Zoom)
Basic Qualifications:
Minimum of two years' post-secondary education and relevant work experience
Experience with Python
Experience with Tensorflow
Additional Qualifications:
Bachelor's degree preferred
Prior experience with OpenAI Gym and/or Baselines would be a very strong asset
Experience with high-level planning of software architecture and API definitions
Ability and interest in communicating architectural considerations and engineering best practices to junior team members
Experience with profiling performance of Python/Tensorflow applications
Software development experience, including responsibility for one or more projects from inception to delivery
Familiarity with a research-oriented working environment
Experience with GitHub for version control and collaboration
The following are not expected, but could be integrated if of interest to the applicant:
Some understanding of or interest in Reinforcement Learning algorithms
Experience with AWS
Basic C++ understanding
Basic experience with, or interest in, assembly
Application: Send a resume and cover-letter to Ann Marie King (aking@seas.harvard.edu). Applications considered on a rolling basis. Informal inquiries to David Parkes (parkes@eecs.harvard.edu) and Matthias Gerstgrasser (matthias@seas.harvard.edu)
